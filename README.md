ESnet perfSONAR Mesh Configuration
==================================

This document contains the configuration files used to build the regular tests and associated dashboards run internally on ESnet. It can also be used as an example for others wishing to deploy a similar infrastructure on their networks. It contains a set of configuration files that can be used as inputs to the [perfSONAR Mesh Configuration](http://code.google.com/p/perfsonar-ps/wiki/MeshConfigurationInstallation) software. It also contains a set of scripts that can be used to a) deploy each configuration file as a JSON file on a web server and b) build a mesh configuration from those deployed JSON files.

Updating the Mesh
-----------------

### Editing Current Mesh Files

Checkout this source code repository then make your changes under the *conf* directory. Commit your changes to this repository and they will automatically be published as JSON [here](http://ps-west.es.net/esnet-mesh_config.json) within 15 minutes.

### Adding New Mesh Files

Any mesh file added to the *conf* directory with the extension *.conf* will automatically get published by the scripts once you commit them.

Updating the Dashboards
-----------------------

### Changing thesholds and pointing at new mesh files

The *maddash* directory contains a file named *gui_agent_configuration.conf*. In this file you may change thresholds for grids, point a new JSON files and alter various other settings related to the display of the dashboards and their grids. Commit any changes to this repostory and they should be deployed within 30 minutes.

### Changing Dashboard Names and Manually Defining Grids

The *maddash* directory contains a file named *maddash.yaml.template*. This is the base maddash.yaml from which the generation scripts create a new maddash.yaml file. You can add any manual settings here. This includes organizing grids into a manually defined set of dashboards. It is also where you can manually define grids, such as those running checks not yet supported by MeshConfig or using non-standard test topologies. Commit any changes to this repostory and they should be deployed within 30 minutes.

Deploying the JSON
------------------
This section is for administrators installing these configuration files and scripts for the first time. If you just want to update the mesh, you can ignore this section.

### System Requirements
 * CentOS Line 6 or greater (other OSes require modifications to scripts)
 * perl-perfSONAR_PS-MeshConfig-BuildJSON (available from perfSONAR Yum)
 * Apache HTTPD

### Installation
You may install the configuration files and scripts from source on a web server you wish to use to publish your configurations as JSON files. The steps to checkout the code and setup the cron script are as follows:
```
cd /opt/perfsonar_ps
git pull https://github.com/esnet/esnet-perfsonar-mesh.git ./esnet-perfsonar-mesh
cp esnet-perfsonar-mesh/scripts/cron-deploy-json /etc/crond.d/cron-deploy-json
```

Deploying the Dashboard
-----------------------
This is a section for administrators installing the scripts to generate a MaDDash configuration for the first time. If you want to just change an existing deployment you may ignore this section. 

### System Requirements
 * CentOS Line 6 or greater (other OSes require modifications to scripts)
 * perl-perfSONAR_PS-MeshConfig-GUIAgent (available from perfSONAR Yum)
 * maddash (available from perfSONAR Yum. See http://software.es.net/maddash)

###I nstallation
You may install the configuration files and scripts from source on a MaDDash server. The steps to checkout the code and setup the cron script are as follows:

```
cd /opt/perfsonar_ps
git pull https://github.com/esnet/esnet-perfsonar-mesh.git ./esnet-perfsonar-mesh
cp esnet-perfsonar-mesh/scripts/cron-generate-maddash-config /etc/crond.d/cron-generate-maddash-config
```
